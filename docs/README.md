- This can be found on the `README.md` file in the root of this project.

## Java classes
The Java classes and records that are used in this project are:
- [**`Main`**](../src/main/java/Main.java)
> The `Main` class is the `entry point` of the application. It contains 1 method, the `main` method.<br/>
> The `main` method is used for a sample run of the program which contains an `iterator` and a `List` with some data.
- [**`Farm`**](../src/main/java/chicken/Farm.java)
> The `Farm` record is used to create a new farm. It contains 3 methods called `chickenType`, `checkFarm` and `checkEgg`.
> <br/>
> The `chickenType` method returns a list of chicken types.<br/>
> The `checkFarm` method takes 3 arguments: `boolean isPsychical`, `int egg` and `String typeChicken`.<br/>
> The `checkEgg` method takes 1 argument: `int egg`.

## How does the conditions work?
> Each basket stores exactly 20 eggs. If the test doesn't come in pairs of 20 it will be false.<br/>
> The chicken types are listed in the List to match the chicken type. If it's not a chicken type it will be false.<br/>
> The eggs have to be psychically located on the Farm itself. If it's not located on the Farm it will be false.<br/>
> The eggs can be bought from the Farm itself. It can be in pairs of 20 exactly from 0 to 1000.<br/>
> There are 3 price options for this in different categories for the eggs.
