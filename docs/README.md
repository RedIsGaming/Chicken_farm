## Java classes
The Java classes and records that are used in this project are:
- [**`Main`**](../src/main/java/Main.java)
> The `Main` class contains 2 methods. The `checkChicken` and the `main` method.<br/>
> The `checkChicken` method is used for the testcases.<br/>
> The `main` method is used for a sample run of the program which contains an iterator and some data.
- [**`Farm`**](../src/main/java/chicken/Farm.java)
> The `Farm` record contains a canonical constructor and another one. `Farm` which is used to create a new farm.<br/>

## How does the conditions work?
> There have to be 0 or more eggs. Each farm can have no more than 1000 eggs stored and each basket stores 20 eggs.<br/>
> There have to be 0 or more chickens types, but the max number of chicken types per chicken is 1.<br/>
> The chicken eggs can't be older than 30 days.<br/>
> The eggs have to be located on a physical Farm.
